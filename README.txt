Welcome to Reverse Encryption Cipher!
How the program works is it needs some things from the user:
    1. The directory of the file the user wants to encrypt.
    2. The directory of the file the users wants to put the encrypted message to.
The program will take the directory of the original file, reverse the message by iterating backwards and reversing the text.
Then it will write those lines to the new file, and then print the original and the result following.
Make sure the directory the user puts in is correct, the program will loop accordingly even if the input is wrong.
